<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
 
<p>Molly had been starting out of her window for about an hour. On her desk, lying between the copies of <em> 
Nature,New Scientist </em>and all the other<br /> scientific jouranls her worked had appeared in, was a well thumbed 
copy of <em>ON THE ROAD. </em>It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she<br />spent in these
four walls the more she felt she needed to be free. </p>
<p> She had spent the last ten years in this room,sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that 
<q>Work is the refuge of people who have<br />nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering 
work, unravelling the secret of the Ilama <strong>DNA, </strong>to be an outstanding achievement, Molly<br />did 
think she had something better to do.</p>
